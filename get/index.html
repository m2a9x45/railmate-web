            Hey, Railmate is still very early on in the development process. I would say we have just reached MVP.
            Which stands for minimum viable product. It pretty much means the most barebones thing that still can 
            solve the problem you're working on. In our case that means letting you search for a station, see the
            next 2 hours of trains leaving from that station. And being able to tap on one and see info about it's route. 
            These are the 3 features we list on our homepage. And that's it. I hope you like it 😉
        </p>
        <p>
            We're looking forward to adding more functionally and feature soon but we wanted to let you try out what we
            have right now. So you can tell us how it is. There's a high chance that the app won't work all the time
            will have some issues with text overlapping and the like. But the information that it provides should be 
            right. Pretty much I wanted to let you know that the experience will most likely not be the best. And that 
            this is the very first version and everything might change. Let us know if you've got any feedback. And 
            thanks for giving Railmate a go! 🚇
